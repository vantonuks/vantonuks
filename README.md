I am an aspiring .NET developer, with background in Java. 
Always passionate about maths, puzzles and computers, I was always excited to use computer to help me better understand mathematical concepts and problems. Starting as amateur C++ coder, I progressed to writing back-end functionality with Java and, finally, C#. I am passionate to learn new technologies, not necessarily limited to back-end development.
